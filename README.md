## üí¨ About Me
üåü Born amidst the scenic beauty of Khulna, Bangladesh, on March 21st, my upbringing in diverse districts instilled in me a profound appreciation for the rich tapestry of cultures woven throughout my homeland. Following the completion of my schooling and college education, I embarked on a transformative journey at the American International University, Bangladesh, where I pursued my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering. Here, amidst the bustling world of technology, I discovered that computer science isn't just a field of study; it's an exhilarating adventure waiting to be explored. My passion lies in unraveling the fun and beauty within the realm of computer science, one line of code at a time. ‚ú®
